version.

You may check out the sources using Git with the following command:

-----------
  $ git clone git://github.com/Yubico/yubico-c-client.git
-----------

This will create a directory 'yubico-c-client'.  Enter the directory:

-----------
  $ cd yubico-c-client
-----------

Autoconf, automake and libtool must be installed.  Help2man is used to
generate the manpages.  Libcurl-dev must be installed.

Generate the build system using:

-----------
  $ autoreconf --install
-----------

Building
--------

To build using the Autoconf, automake and libtool infrastructure,
which is recommend for more advanced purposes especially for
cross-compilation and shared library support, build it as follows.

-----------
  $ ./configure
  $ make check && sudo make install
-----------

Command-line tools
------------------

There is one command line tool, ykclient, to validate a particular
OTP.  It needs a client id, which you can allocate for yourself on
Yubico's web site.

Example session below.

-----------
jas@mocca:~/src/yubico-c-client$ ./ykclient 
Usage: ./ykclient <client_id> <yubikey_otp>
 CLIENT_ID: your client id integer
 YUBIKEY_OTP: One-time password generated by yubikey
jas@mocca:~/src/yubico-c-client$ ./ykclient 16 dteffujehknhfjbrjnlnldnhcujvddbikngjrtgh
Input:
  client id: 16
  token: dteffujehknhfjbrjnlnldnhcujvddbikngjrtgh
Verification output (2): Yubikey OTP was replayed (REPLAYED_OTP)
jas@mocca:~/src/yubico-c-client$
